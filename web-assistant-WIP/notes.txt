Okay so we have it sending audio when you click start, now we just need to write
it correctly using python using the WAVE library.

Got it almost, trying to figure out how to write the str to the file is proving challenging...

So we got it writing to a flat file, think we need to get the encoding figured out. Maybe
transfer our progress back to our original project instead of relying on apache and whisper
which really just does what we already do... but worse. Think it's the 12 to 32 bit function 
in our code needs to be added to this maybe?o
